Install the mingw environment using CONFIGURE_F17.sh.
Install additional packages using CONFIGURE_LIBRARIES.sh.

Enable the Windows installer by running configure: "./configure --enable-win_installer".
Type "cd win_src && make" to create the unsigned windows installer.

----------------------------------------

The following instructions describe creating a signed Windows installer:

Signing tool "osslsigncode" for Authenticode signing of EXE/CAB files is required.
Please install package osslsigncode.

Please define and export these Environment variables in order to sign files:
Environment variable FOUO_BE_CERT must point to the code signing certificate.
Environment variable FOUO_BE_CERT_PASSWORD must contain the password for the code signing certificate.

File uninstall.exe must also be present so that it, too, can be signed.
Unfortunately, obtaining it is convoluted:
    1) Create the unsigned installer by typing "make", as described above.
    2) Run the unsigned installer on a Windows system.  This action will
       additionally install the uninstaller.
    3) Copy the uninstaller from the Windows system back into this directory.
       It should be at path \c:\Program Files (x86)\Bulk Extractor <version>\uninstall.exe.
If the system clock on your Windows system is slower, you may need to "touch uninstall.exe"
after it is installed in this directory.

Now, run "make signed".
