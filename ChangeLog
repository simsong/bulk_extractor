Now -I flags are added to CFLAGS, CXXFLAGS, and CPPFLAGS. Also the plugins are now not compiled as part of bulk_extractor, so we can remove bulk_extractor's usage of libtool

2010-12-02  Simson Garfinkel  <simsong@Silver-Surfer.local>

	* src/bulk_extractor.cpp (process_extract): added "once" to recursion control block so that printer only prints 4096 bytes (and doesn't keep printing other areas).

2010-12-01  Simson Garfinkel  <simsong@m.ern.nps.edu>

	* src/scan_pdf.cpp (scan_pdf): ignore inflate() return and reprocess if zs.total_out>0;

	* src/scan_zip.cpp (scan_zip): changed compr_size and uncompr_size
	from u_int to int in an attempt to fix the crashing problem.  I
	suspect that they are being caused by improper sign extension

2010-08-26  Simson Garfinkel  <simsong@Silver-Surfer.local>

	* src/feature_recorder.h (feature_recorder *>): removed outdir from all of the prototypes; it's never changed, so it only needs to be in one place.

	* src/bulk_extractor.cpp (main): significant changes in handling
	of scanners. Now we enable or disable scanners (not feature
	recorders), and disabled scanners do not run (rather than having
	them run but not record their results.) This will improve speed significantly.
