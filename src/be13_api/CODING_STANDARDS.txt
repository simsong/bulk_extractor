Coding Standards v1.0
Simson L. Garfinkel
December 3, 2013

All standards are based on compromise. These standards seem to be a
good compromise between a variety of coding styles and existing
standards.

Executive summary:

* No tabs in source code.

  Legacy code has tabs at 8 characters; they can be freely converted
  to spaces as necessary.

* Indent at 4 spaces. 

* Open braces start on the SAME LINE for:
  - if statements
  - inline functions in .h headers
  - Java function declarations

* Open braces start on NEXT LINE for:
  - C function declarations

* We use the following lines/configuration variables to try to enforce
  the above:

  For EMACS at the top of c programs:
  /* -*- mode: C++; c-basic-offset: 4; indent-tabs-mode: nil -*- */

  In .emacs files:
  (setq-default indent-tabs-mode nil)
  (setq c-basic-offset 4)
